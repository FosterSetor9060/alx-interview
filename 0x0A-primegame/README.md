Prime Game
Algorithm
You’ll need to leverage your understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization to solve a competitive game scenario.
The challenge involves determining the winner of a game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.
Concepts Needed:
Prime Numbers:
Understand what prime numbers are.
Implement efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a given range.
Sieve of Eratosthenes:
An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. This can be particularly useful for this task.
Game Theory:
Understand basic principles of competitive games where players take turns.
Grasp the concept of optimal play.
Understand win conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.
Dynamic Programming/Memoization:
Use previous results to make future calculations faster. This may be necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.
Python Programming:
Implement loops and conditional statements for game logic and algorithms.
Use arrays and lists for storing integers and tracking removed numbers.
